## Data Collection




Scraping and saving the data for creating a network of authors (feel free to use other tools to scrape other websites, the recommended size of network is between 100 - 500 nodes). Install the python arXiv scraping module from [here](https://github.com/Mahdisadjadi/arxivscraper). You can choose any category of research from arXiv. The website also provides a clear documentation on how to scrape and store the data using the popular pandas dataframe object. Pandas is a powerful tool to store, analyze and visualize data, but you are free to choose your database of choice.
